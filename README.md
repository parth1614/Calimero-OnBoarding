# Calimero<sup>TM</sup> Network: The Private Sharding and Privacy Toolkit

Calimero<sup>TM</sup> is a customizable sidechain that is built upon leveraging the NEAR protocol and provides ***private sharding***. Secure private shard infrastructure lets you protect your data while leveraging open-source blockchains' business benefits like being **high-performant**, **incredibly secure**, **fast**, and having **infinite scalability**, all while supporting **sustainability**.
