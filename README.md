# Calimero<sup>TM</sup> Network: The Private Sharding and Privacy Toolkit

Calimero<sup>TM</sup> is a customizable sidechain that is built upon leveraging the NEAR protocol and provides ***private sharding***. Secure private shard infrastructure lets you protect your data while leveraging open-source blockchains' business benefits like being **high-performant**, **incredibly secure**, **fast**, and having **infinite scalability**, all while supporting **sustainability**.

Access our official [Documentation](https://docs.calimero.network/) & Claimero Bridge [CodeBase](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/bridge-contracts) for more insights.

Currently, Calimero<sup>TM</sup> Network features include:
- `Calimero Beacon`
    - This management console allows users to quickly ship their applications without having to manage their own infrastructure.
- `Calimero Borealis`
    - The Borealia allows you to launch a private EVM-Compatible Shard interoperable with both Ethereum and Aurora.

- `Calimero Genesis`
    - Genesis bootstraps a private shard with a single unique command that generates a customizable shard configuration for development, testing, or deploying into production.
- `Calimero Hive`
    - Hive installs applications and plugins for the marketplace immediately out of the box, without any requirements of coding
- `Calimero Ghost`
    - Ghost toolkit provides the developers the ability to generate and build private smart contracts between parties using encryption and zero-knowledge techniques
- `Calimero SDK`
    - Calimero SDK is NEAR's intuitive developer tooling that lets you build contracts in common languages like Rust, JavaScript or AssemblyScript
